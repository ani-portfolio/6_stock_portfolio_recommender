# RAG-LLM Powered Stock Recommendation System

## Summary

A stock recommendation system powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology and large language models. This application combines real-time financial data with content-based recommendation, sentiment analysis and financial metrics to provide personalized investment insights and portfolio recommendations through an intuitive web interface.

The system utilizes a batch processing pipeline to continuously update stock data and embeddings, enabling semantic search capabilities that help users discover relevant investment opportunities based on natural language queries.

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](media/architecture.png)

The application follows a modern batch RAG-LLM architecture with two main pipelines:

### Batch Indexing Pipeline
- **Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance API for real-time stock data and financial metrics, NewsAPI & HuggingFace Sentiment Analysis model for stock sentiment
- **Data Storage**: BigQuery for structured historical data storage
- **Document Processing**: LangChain for data chunking and preprocessing
- **Embedding Generation**: HuggingFace Embedding model convert text to semantic vectors
- **Vector Storage**: Pinecone for scalable similarity search and retrieval

### Query Processing Pipeline
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit-based user interface for natural language queries
- **Query Embedding**: Same embedding model ensures semantic consistency
- **Vector Search**: Pinecone performs similarity search to find relevant stock data
- **Context Assembly**: Retrieved documents are combined for comprehensive context
- **LLM Generation**: LangChain Groq generates personalized portfolio recommendations
- **Results**: Data-driven investment insights and stock analysis
